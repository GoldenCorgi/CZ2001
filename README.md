# Project 1


You can run the ipynb file in your local jupyter notebook, but preferably used in a Colab setting, as it has been tested rigorously in a Colab environment - making it more suitable for use as well.

If running locally, there is a need to pip install libraries that are less common, such as gradio, tqdm.

You can open the online version here as well by clicking the button below.
